# An Icon Classifier Android App
Written by Margaret Maynard-Reid, ML GDE

This is an end to end tutorial from model training to deployment to an Android app:

1. How to create an icon classifier with TFLite Model Maker, with just a few lines of code. Read the [tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/icon-classifier-with-tflite-model-maker-9263c0021f72) for details.
2. Deploy the icons-50.tflite model to Android with just a few links of code with TensorFlow Lite [metadata](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert/metadata), [Codegen](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/codegen) and [ML Model Binding](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features#tensor-flow-lite-models) in Android Studio Preview 4.1. Read the [tutorial](https://medium.com/@margaretmz/icon-classifier-android-app-1fc0b727f761) for details.

Many thanks to the TensorFlow Lite team for their great work on making this possible, and their support in helping answer my questions about these new features.
